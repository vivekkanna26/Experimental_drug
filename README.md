# Experimental_drug
Algo created using python sklearn and Keras

Based on a new experimental drug test on 2100 participants both young and old side effects on them was tracked for mass side effects predicted when given out to the world requirement. Computation method of Modelling using TensorFlow and Keras was used to train and test using the Sequential model to arrive at the result. A confusion matrix was built to explain the prediction on the said basis and found the drug is highly safe to use considering the less percentage of side effects tracked.


model works on the priciple to check if the experimental drug is of good accuracy.
